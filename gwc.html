<p class="w3-center"><em>Similarities between Python & Scratch </em></p>
	<p>I noticed that there is more freedom with Python, however, there is more room for errors to occur although, it is easier to detect where you went wrong. On Scratch, it was basically dragging, but on python, it's typing up a script. <br> They both use loops, need coordinates, have forward/move blank, use variables and functions, and there are multiple ways to draw shapes such as loops, hardcoding or just moving.</p>
